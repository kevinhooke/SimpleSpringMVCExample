#Simple Spring MVC Example Webapp

##Why?
Sometimes you need a test app that's nothing more than the simplest 
possible app to use as either:

* a starting point to get started on some other app
* an app to use for testing deployments to a different server or platform
* a simplest case example of an app using a given framework, for comparing with 
other frameworks.

If you remember struts-blank.war from back in the day then this is the same idea.

##What is this?
This is a simplest case web app using Spring MVC that meets the above needs.

It doesn't have any database dependencies, because it's that simple.

##What Version of Spring MVC is it using?
3.1.0
